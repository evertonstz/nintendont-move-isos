###How to use

Just extract all your legally obtained gamecube isos (*wink wink*) to a folder and put the python script and the wiitdb.txt in the same folder as the ISOs, run the python script and it'll create a subfolder named "game" and the folders for the games inside (with the game ids), it'll also copy the game and rename them (even multidisc games).

In the end you'll just have to copy the "game" folder to your HDD and nintendont will see your games.

This script is based on user's Gemini from GBAtemp, you can find it in this [thread.](https://gbatemp.net/threads/mass-rename-folder-creation-for-nintendont.399770/ "thread.")
